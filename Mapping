Got it! Let’s make it precise and factual, no extra fluff or assumptions.

### 1. Forward Kinematics (FK)

* **Definition:** Computes the position and orientation of the end-effector (robot hand or gripper) given the joint or servo angles.
* **Use:** If you know the servo angles, FK tells you where the end-effector is in space.
* **Formula:**
  {Position} = f(theta_1, theta_2, ..., theta_n)

### 2. Inverse Kinematics (IK)

* **Definition:** Computes the joint or servo angles required to reach a specific position and orientation of the end-effector.
* **Use:** If you know the position of the cube you want to pick, IK tells you what each servo angle should be.
* **Challenge:** There may be multiple solutions, and some positions may be unreachable.

### 3. Workspace Analysis

* **Definition:** Studies all positions that the robot’s end-effector can reach given its joint limits.
* **Use:** Helps check if the cube is within the robot’s reach.

### 4. Trajectory Planning / Motion Planning

* **Definition:** Determines a path for the end-effector to move smoothly from its current position to the target position.
* **Use:** Ensures the robot moves without collisions and respects joint speed/acceleration limits.

### 5. Jacobian (optional but useful)

* **Definition:** Relates small changes in joint angles to small changes in end-effector position and orientation.
* **Use:** Helps in precise control, velocity control, and some numerical IK solutions.

### Terms you should study to calculate servo angles to pick a cube:

1. **Inverse Kinematics (IK)** – the core concept to calculate angles from position.
2. **Forward Kinematics (FK)** – needed to verify your IK solution.
3. **Workspace and Reachability** – to ensure the cube is within range.
4. **Trajectory / Motion Planning** – to move smoothly to the cube.
5. **Joint Limits and Servo Constraints** – practical considerations for safe motion.
6. **Basic 3D Geometry** – positions, distances, and rotations.
7. **Homogeneous Transformation Matrices** – used to describe positions and orientations in FK/IK calculations.
